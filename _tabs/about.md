Hello!

I am Raj, a graduate student in Electrical and Computer Engineering at University of Illinois Urbana Champaign. I am fortunate to be advised by Prof. Tamer Ba≈üar. This blog personifies my relentless curiosity and excitement for Game Theory and my quest to understand the intricracies of information there in. While most of the material on the blog is not new, it would have my lense on it. The aim to simplify some interesting concepts in game theory, by providing intuitive explainations while differing rigrous treatments to source material. I hope it serves as a record, if not for anyone, at least just me, to come back to. Any comments ot suggestions on the content is appreciated.
